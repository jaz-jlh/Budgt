# Budgt
======

This is an Android application I've built from scratch. It is used to record transactions, track spending habits, and monitor account balances. It is not connected to any bank accounts or credit/debit cards - the entry process is entirely manual.

Planned Features:
* Tool to generate statements (easily compare to bank statements)
* Create budgets to follow and track progress by time period
* Clicking on pie chart will break down category
* Search transactions
* Edit transactions
* Replace Toasts with Snackbars for user-friendliness
* Various performance improvements related to loading and saving data

I have used many examples and tutorials to help create this app and features within it. The feature/function and the associated website are listed below:
